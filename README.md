Project Overview
The project involves creating a Python program to manage student grades, designed to be simple yet effective for educational settings. The program allows users to input grades for different subjects, calculates the average grade, determines the corresponding letter grade, calculates the GPA, and displays all relevant student information in a structured format.

Key Activities
Class Definition (Student):

Initialization (__init__): The class initializes with the student's name and an empty dictionary to store grades.
Adding Grades (add_grade): A method to input grades for various subjects. These grades are stored in a dictionary where the subject is the key, and the grade is the value.
Calculating Average (calculate_average): This method calculates the average of all grades entered for a student.
Determining Letter Grade (determine_letter_grade): Based on the calculated average, this method assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).
Calculating GPA (calculate_gpa): This method converts the average grade into a GPA on a 4.0 scale.
Displaying Information (display_info): This method prints the student's name, grades for each subject, average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
User Interaction:

The main() function handles user input, prompting for the student's name, subjects, and grades.
Users can input multiple grades for different subjects, and the program continues to accept input until the user types 'done'.
The program performs basic error handling to ensure that grades are entered as valid numbers.
Program Execution:

The main() function serves as the entry point of the program, executing the sequence of actions from data input to displaying the final results.
